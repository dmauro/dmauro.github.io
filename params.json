I helped maintain the app and was crucial to bringing the app to iPhone/iPod Touch and iOS 7.\r\n\r\n![DrawQuest screenshot](https://raw.github.com/dmauro/dmauro.github.io/master/images/drawquest.jpg)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n###GetCreative###\r\n[https://github.com/canvasnetworks/get-creative](https://github.com/canvasnetworks/get-creative)\r\n\r\nI designed and implemented all aspects of GetCreative to explore possible solutions for getting people into the creative habit. It is a Chrome extension and accompanying Node.js website that delivers daily challenges that can be completed in-browser. The extension leverages the power of the Chrome extension for app-like notifications while taking advantage of a Node.js for a fast dev and deploy cycle.\r\n\r\n![GetCreative screenshot](https://raw.github.com/dmauro/dmauro.github.io/master/images/getcreative.jpg)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n###Keypress###\r\n[http://dmauro.github.io/Keypress](http://dmauro.github.io/Keypress)\r\n\r\nKeypress is a hobby project I've been actively working on for some time now. It allows for very complex keyboard bindings to be created. I started on this as I was working on a JavaScript based video game and realized I needed more complex bindings than other similar libraries afforded.\r\n\r\n![Keypress screenshot](https://raw.github.com/dmauro/dmauro.github.io/master/images/keypress.jpg)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n###Others###\r\nSee what else I've been up to: [http://github.com/dmauro](http://github.com/dmauro)","google":"UA-15791425-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
